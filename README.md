# ひなまる　Discord Bot
ひなまる is the first discord bot I've ever create.

## Notice
Due to discord.py not being maintain anymore, hinamaru will also follow suite, and soon be broken.

I wasn't very verse in Python when I first started this project, As a result, a lot of code can be optimized, but it is too much effort now for a discord bot that will soon be broken.


### A few things I would improve for example:
#### Hori_API cog
* use dataclass to store responses
* use aiohttp instead of requests
* make multi-requests a paginator instead of spamming the channel (getting in trouble with discord rate limit)

#### Music Cog
* use dataclass to store server profiles
* make every player related function async

#### Others
* implement sqlite3 instead of json
* make config file a cog
* mess around with jishaku extension settings
